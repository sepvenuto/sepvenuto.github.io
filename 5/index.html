                    I was partially inspired by common examples of ananagrams/hybrids I saw online so I knew I would have some to work with if my others don't work, and then I also included my interests of crossfit and video games, and my studying computer science and French, and going to Berkeley. I also have descriptions of myself and my sister, as well as our two pet cats</p>

                    <h4>Observations</h4>
                    <p>The more specific or real-world based (berkeley, formula 1) the prompt, the less likeley the model was to be able to adhear to it. For the computer science student at Berkeley, I thought it was interesting that there was nothing suggesting computer science in the images. It was interesting that as we increase the number of inference steps, the details of the person became more realistic (the refelction on the glasses, for example). Also, the B for berkeley appeared on the shirt. For the formula one, as we increased the number of inference steps, we also increased the amountof detail in the women, but it was interesting that the formula one never really appeared much beyond the one woman's shirt rsembling the VCARB livery in the less steps. It is also interesting that the glasses became sort of neon and the colors more vibrant with more steps. For the cat, the alignment with the prompt was pretty good with less inference steps, although the computer screen was blank. As we increased the steps, the image got more detailed, but the screenhad details that don't make as much sense, and the colors seemed oversaturated. Also, the cat is no longer looking at the computer.</p>
