                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div class="project-content-body">
                    <p>In this project, I explored the relationship between perspective, focal length, and camera positioning. The goal was to develop an intuitive understanding of how these factors affect image composition and visual perception through hands-on photography experiments.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding perspective distortion in close-up photography</li>
                        <li>Exploring architectural perspective compression effects</li>
                        <li>Creating the classic "dolly zoom" cinematographic effect</li>
                        <li>Analyzing the relationship between focal length, distance, and visual perception</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>What I observed:</strong> In the close up photo, features that stick out more were warped to appear even larger, such as my nose and eyes. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> I think this occured because the relative distance from the camera is much more significant when the camera is closer. This means that the couple of inches between where my nose starts and where my forehead starts is much more significant when the camera is only a couple of inches away, when compared with when the camera is multiple feet away, and those few inches are less significant. It is interesting that the far away looks more "normal" than the close version, because I wonder if humans perceive things in this similar way. I guess we're never that close to another person, so the close up looks warped because it's different from our normal perception.</p>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>What I observed:</strong> [Describe how the two images differ. How does the sense of depth change? How do the buildings or objects at different distances appear to relate to each other?]</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Perspective compression effect:</strong> This is similar to the photos of people from part 1, I think. Just like the closer image of a person enhanced the depth differences because the smaller distances were more significant when the camera was closer, I think something similar happened here. When we take the photo from further away, the distance from a specific landmark to another is relatively a smaller distance to the distance to the camera than if the camera is closer to the two landmarks. This causes the objects to be "flattened" because their relative distance from the camera isn't actually that different from the other objects. If two objects are two feet apart, when the camera is two feet from the objects, the distance is quite far (100% of the distance). When the camera is 10 feet from the objects, it's 20% of the distance, so that difference will appear to be less deep. </p>
