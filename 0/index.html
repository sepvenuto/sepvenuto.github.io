                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <div class="project-content-body">
                    <p>In this project, I explored the relationship between perspective, focal length, and camera positioning. The goal was to develop an intuitive understanding of how these factors affect image composition and visual perception through hands-on photography experiments.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Key Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understanding perspective distortion in close-up photography</li>
                        <li>Exploring architectural perspective compression effects</li>
                        <li>Creating the classic "dolly zoom" cinematographic effect</li>
                        <li>Analyzing the relationship between focal length, distance, and visual perception</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="project-content-body">
                    <h3>Approach</h3>
                    <p>[Describe your setup: Who was your subject? What camera/phone did you use? How close was "close up" vs "stepped back"? What focal lengths or zoom levels did you use?]</p>

                    <h3>Results</h3>

                    <h3>Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>What I observed:</strong> [Describe the differences you noticed between the two photos. How did the facial proportions change? Which features appeared more prominent in each shot?]</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong> [Explain your understanding of why the close-up photo looks distorted while the zoomed photo looks more natural. Discuss distance relationships, angular size, and perspective distortion.]</p>

                    <h4>Technical Details</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Close shot:</strong> Distance: [X feet], Focal length: [X mm or zoom level]</li>

                        <li><strong>Subject size:</strong> [How did you ensure the face was roughly the same size in both frames?]</li>
                    </ul>
